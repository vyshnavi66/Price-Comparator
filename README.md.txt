## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice on Accuracy & Coverage

> Most real e-commerce sites (Amazon, Walmart, etc.) **block automated scraping heavily**.  
> For demonstration, this tool returns:
> - **FakeStoreAPI results for Amazon US** (realistic but demo data)
> - **Hardcoded demo results for Walmart, BestBuy, Target, and Flipkart**
> - Returns `[]` or `"Blocked by anti-bot"` if scraping was blocked  
> This is explained and documented for transparency.

üìù Notes / Known Limitations
Some e-commerce sites block bots/scraping‚Äîresults may use sample/demo data.

The AI feature depends on a working OpenAI API key.

Product accuracy is only as good as the data available.

For Indian queries, only Flipkart is supported currently.
